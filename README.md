# GraphEditor


## Getting Started

Make sure you have the latest packages installed

```
npm install
bower install
```

Note: If you don't have `npm` installed, make sure you have
[node](http://nodejs.com) installed. If you don't have bower,
`npm install -g bower`.

The above steps will download all the required software to
build and run this app, such as [grunt](http://gruntjs.com),
[requirejs](http://requirejs.org), and [jquery](http://jquery.com).

## Running the server

You can run your app using `grunt preview`. This will start a
server on `localhost:8000`, meaning you can simply go to the
url [localhost:8000/index.htm](http://localhost:8000/index.htm)
while it's running.

If you'd like to run the compiled version, run
`grunt preview-live`.
